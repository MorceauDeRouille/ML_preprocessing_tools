# ML_preprocessing_tools
The purpose of this repository is to provide an efficient way to manipulate dataframes content.
The tools are still at their debut, and need refactoring. Even if this repository main purpose consist of preprocessing tools, I added at start some ML funcitonnalities to apply them on dataframes. Those functionnalities will soon be deleted from this repository.
